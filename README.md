## Branching Strategy

- Every ticket or feature should have its own branch.
- Use the following naming convention for branches:
  - `feature/<ticket-number>-<short-description>` 
  - `bugfix/<ticket-number>-<short-description>` 
  - `hotfix/<short-description>` for urgent fixes 
- Only merge working and reviewed code into the `main` branch.
- Use pull requests for merging and require code reviews before approval.
- Keep your branch updated with `main` by regularly pulling the latest changes.
